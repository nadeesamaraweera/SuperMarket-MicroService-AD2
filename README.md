# Supermarket Microservices

Welcome to the **Supermarket Microservices** project! This system is designed to provide a scalable and modular architecture for managing a supermarket's core operations. It features microservices for handling inventory, orders, employees, and product data. Each service is built as a separate microservice with its own API, following modern microservices architecture principles and integrating seamlessly using Spring Boot.

## Microservices Architecture

This project implements a microservices architecture using **Spring Boot**, **Node.js**, and **Python**.

### Services Overview

1. **Eureka Server** – Service discovery server.
2. **Product Service** – Manages product information.
3. **Order Service** – Handles order processing and tracking.
4. **Inventory Service** – Manages inventory (Node.js).
5. **Customer Service** – Manages customer data (Python).
